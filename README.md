# Note to Shelf

<!--

Create a shell script that functions as a command-line note-taking tool. This tool should help you quickly capture and organize thoughts, reminders, and tasks directly from the terminal.

## Requirements

- The script must support the following commands:
    - Add a new note: `note add "Your note text here"`
    - List all notes: `note list`
    - Search notes: `note search "keyword"`
- Implementation requirements:
    - Store notes in a text file with proper date/time stamps
    - Include error handling for all commands
    - Implement input validation
    - Add proper logging for debugging

## Testing Criteria

Your script will be tested against the following scenarios:

- Adding notes with special characters
- Proper file operations (read/write)
- Correct date/time formatting
- Search functionality accuracy
- Proper exit codes for success/failure

## Example Usage

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Add a note
$ ./note.sh add "Schedule dentist appointment"
Note added successfully

# List all notes
$ ./note.sh list
2025-01-06 12:04:06 - Schedule dentist appointment
2025-01-06 12:05:04 - Buy groceries

# Search notes
$ ./note.sh search "dentist"
2025-01-06 12:04:06 - Schedule dentist appointment
```
